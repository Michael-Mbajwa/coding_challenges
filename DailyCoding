A teacher must divide a class of students into two teams to play dodgeball. Unfortunately, not all the kids get along, and several refuse to be put on the same team as that of their enemies.

Given an adjacency list of students and their enemies, write an algorithm that finds a satisfactory pair of teams, or returns False if none exists.

For example, given the following enemy graph you should return the teams {0, 1, 4, 5} and {2, 3}.

students = {
    0: [3],
    1: [2],
    2: [1, 4],
    3: [0, 4, 5],
    4: [2, 3],
    5: [3]
}

On the other hand, given the input below, you should return False.

students = {
    0: [3],
    1: [2],
    2: [1, 3, 4],
    3: [0, 2, 4, 5],
    4: [2, 3],
    5: [3]
}

You have N stones in a row, and would like to create from them a pyramid. This pyramid should be constructed such that the height of each stone increases by one until reaching the tallest stone, after which the heights decrease by one. In addition, the start and end stones of the pyramid should each be one stone high.

You can change the height of any stone by paying a cost of 1 unit to lower its height by 1, as many times as necessary. Given this information, determine the lowest cost method to produce this pyramid.

For example, given the stones [1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1], the optimal solution is to pay 2 to create [0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1].

A competitive runner would like to create a route that starts and ends at his house, with the condition that the route goes entirely uphill at first, and then entirely downhill.

Given a dictionary of places of the form {location: elevation}, and a dictionary mapping paths between some of these locations to their corresponding distances, find the length of the shortest route satisfying the condition above. Assume the runner's home is location 0.

For example, suppose you are given the following input:

elevations = {0: 5, 1: 25, 2: 15, 3: 20, 4: 10}
paths = {
    (0, 1): 10,
    (0, 2): 8,
    (0, 3): 15,
    (1, 3): 12,
    (2, 4): 10,
    (3, 4): 5,
    (3, 0): 17,
    (4, 0): 10
}

In this case, the shortest valid path would be 0 -> 2 -> 4 -> 0, with a distance of 28.

A group of houses is connected to the main water plant by means of a set of pipes. A house can either be connected by a set of pipes extending directly to the plant, or indirectly by a pipe to a nearby house which is otherwise connected.

For example, here is a possible configuration, where A, B, and C are houses, and arrows represent pipes:

A <--> B <--> C <--> plant

Each pipe has an associated cost, which the utility company would like to minimize. Given an undirected graph of pipe connections, return the lowest cost configuration of pipes such that each house has access to water.

In the following setup, for example, we can remove all but the pipes from plant to A, plant to B, and B to C, for a total cost of 16.

There are M people sitting in a row of N seats, where M < N. Your task is to redistribute people such that there are no gaps between any of them, while keeping overall movement to a minimum.

For example, suppose you are faced with an input of [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], where 0 represents an empty seat and 1 represents a person. In this case, one solution would be to place the person on the right in the fourth seat.

You are given a circular lock with three wheels, each of which display the numbers 0 through 9 in order. Each of these wheels rotate clockwise and counterclockwise.

In addition, the lock has a certain number of "dead ends", meaning that if you turn the wheels to one of these combinations, the lock becomes stuck in that state and cannot be opened.

Let us consider a "move" to be a rotation of a single wheel by one digit, in either direction.

A Boolean formula can be said to be satisfiable if there is a way to assign truth values to each variable such that the entire formula evaluates to true.

For example, suppose we have the following formula, where the symbol ¬ is used to denote negation:

(¬c OR b) AND (b OR c) AND (¬b OR c) AND (¬c OR ¬a)

One way to satisfy this formula would be to let a = False, b = True, and c = True.

This type of formula, with AND statements joining tuples containing exactly one OR, is known as 2-CNF.

Given a 2-CNF formula, find a way to assign truth values to satisfy it, or return False if this is impossible.

PageRank is an algorithm used by Google to rank the importance of different websites. While there have been changes over the years, the central idea is to assign each site a score based on the importance of other pages that link to that page.

More mathematically, suppose there are N sites, and each site i has a certain count Ci of outgoing links. Then the score for a particular site Sj is defined as :

score(Sj) = (1 - d) / N + d * (score(Sx) / Cx+ score(Sy) / Cy+ ... + score(Sz) / Cz))

Here, Sx, Sy, ..., Sz denote the scores of all the other sites that have outgoing links to Sj, and d is a damping factor, usually set to around 0.85, used to model the probability that a user will stop searching.

Given a directed graph of links between various websites, write a program that calculates each site's page rank.

You are given an N by N matrix of random letters and a dictionary of words. Find the maximum number of words that can be packed on the board from the given dictionary.

A word is considered to be able to be packed on the board if:

    It can be found in the dictionary
    It can be constructed from untaken letters by other words found so far on the board
    The letters are adjacent to each other (vertically and horizontally, not diagonally).

Each tile can be visited only once by any word.

For example, given the following dictionary:

reduce (also known as fold) is a function that takes in an array, a combining function, and an initial value and builds up a result by calling the combining function on each element of the array, left to right. For example, we can write sum() in terms of reduce:

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def sum(lst):
    return reduce(lst, add, 0)

This should call add on the initial value with the first element of the array, and then the result of that with the second element of the array, and so on until we reach the end, when we return the sum of the array.

Soundex is an algorithm used to categorize phonetically, such that two names that sound alike but are spelled differently have the same representation.

Soundex maps every name to a string consisting of one letter and three numbers, like M460.

One version of the algorithm is as follows:

    Remove consecutive consonants with the same sound (for example, change ck -> c).
    Keep the first letter. The remaining steps only apply to the rest of the string.
    Remove all vowels, including y, w, and h.
    Replace all consonants with the following digits:
        b, f, p, v → 1
        c, g, j, k, q, s, x, z → 2
        d, t → 3
        l → 4
        m, n → 5
        r → 6
    If you don't have three numbers yet, append zeros until you do. Keep the first three numbers.

Using this scheme, Jackson and Jaxen both map to J250.

A ternary search tree is a trie-like data structure where each node may have up to three children. Here is an example which represents the words code, cob, be, ax, war, and we.

       c
    /  |  \
   b   o   w
 / |   |   |
a  e   d   a
|    / |   | \ 
x   b  e   r  e  

The tree is structured according to the following rules:

    left child nodes link to words lexicographically earlier than the parent prefix
    right child nodes link to words lexicographically later than the parent prefix
    middle child nodes continue the current word

For instance, since code is the first word inserted in the tree, and cob lexicographically precedes cod, cob is represented as a left child extending from cod.

Implement insertion and search functions for a ternary search tree.

A typical American-style crossword puzzle grid is an N x N matrix with black and white squares, which obeys the following rules:

    Every white square must be part of an "across" word and a "down" word.
    No word can be fewer than three letters long.
    Every white square must be reachable from every other white square.
    The grid is rotationally symmetric (for example, the colors of the top left and bottom right squares must match).

Write a program to determine whether a given matrix qualifies as a crossword grid.

Design a system to crawl and copy all of Wikipedia using a distributed network of machines.

More specifically, suppose your server has access to a set of client machines. Your client machines can execute code you have written to access Wikipedia pages, download and parse their data, and write the results to a database.

Some questions you may want to consider as part of your solution are:

    How will you reach as many pages as possible?
    How can you keep track of pages that have already been visited?
    How will you deal with your client machines being blacklisted?
    How can you update your database when Wikipedia pages are added or updated?

You are given an array X of floating-point numbers x1, x2, ... xn. These can be rounded up or down to create a corresponding array Y of integers y1, y2, ... yn.

Write an algorithm that finds an appropriate Y array with the following properties:

    The rounded sums of both arrays should be equal.
    The absolute pairwise difference between elements is minimized. In other words, |x1- y1| + |x2- y2| + ... + |xn- yn| should be as small as possible.

For example, suppose your input is [1.3, 2.3, 4.4]. In this case you cannot do better than [1, 2, 5], which has an absolute difference of |1.3 - 1| + |2.3 - 2| + |4.4 - 5| = 1.

You are given a binary tree in a peculiar string representation. Each node is written in the form (lr), where l corresponds to the left child and r corresponds to the right child.

If either l or r is null, it will be represented as a zero. Otherwise, it will be represented by a new (lr) pair.

Here are a few examples:

    A root node with no children: (00)
    A root node with two children: ((00)(00))
    An unbalanced tree with three consecutive left children: ((((00)0)0)0)

Given this representation, determine the depth of the tree.

You are given a string formed by concatenating several words corresponding to the integers zero through nine and then anagramming.

For example, the input could be 'niesevehrtfeev', which is an anagram of 'threefiveseven'. Note that there can be multiple instances of each integer.

Given this string, return the original integers in sorted order. In the example above, this would be 357.

This problem was asked by Spotify.

You have access to ranked lists of songs for various users. Each song is represented as an integer, and more preferred songs appear earlier in each list. For example, the list [4, 1, 7] indicates that a user likes song 4 the best, followed by songs 1 and 7.

Given a set of these ranked lists, interleave them to create a playlist that satisfies everyone's priorities.

For example, suppose your input is {[1, 7, 3], [2, 1, 6, 7, 9], [3, 9, 5]}. In this case a satisfactory playlist could be [2, 1, 6, 7, 3, 9, 5].

Mastermind is a two-player game in which the first player attempts to guess the secret code of the second. In this version, the code may be any six-digit number with all distinct digits.

Each turn the first player guesses some number, and the second player responds by saying how many digits in this number correctly matched their location in the secret code. For example, if the secret code were 123456, then a guess of 175286 would score two, since 1 and 6 were correctly placed.

Write an algorithm which, given a sequence of guesses and their scores, determines whether there exists some secret code that could have produced them.

For example, for the following scores you should return True, since they correspond to the secret code 123456:

{175286: 2, 293416: 3, 654321: 0}

However, it is impossible for any key to result in the following scores, so in this case you should return False:

{123456: 4, 345678: 4, 567890: 4}

A quack is a data structure combining properties of both stacks and queues. It can be viewed as a list of elements written left to right such that three operations are possible:

    push(x): add a new item x to the left end of the list
    pop(): remove and return the item on the left end of the list
    pull(): remove the item on the right end of the list.

Implement a quack using three stacks and O(1) additional memory, so that the amortized time for any push, pop, or pull operation is O(1).

Implement a key value store, where keys and values are integers, with the following methods:

    update(key, vl): updates the value at key to val, or sets it if doesn't exist
    get(key): returns the value with key, or None if no such value exists
    max_key(val): returns the largest key with value val, or None if no key with that value exists

For example, if we ran the following calls:

kv.update(1, 1)
kv.update(2, 1)

And then called kv.max_key(1), it should return 2, since it's the largest key with value 1.

The “active time” of a courier is the time between the pickup and dropoff of a delivery. Given a set of data formatted like the following:

(delivery id, timestamp, pickup/dropoff)

Calculate the total active time in seconds. A courier can pick up multiple orders before dropping them off. The timestamp is in unix epoch seconds.

For example, if the input is the following:

(1, 1573280047, 'pickup')
(1, 1570320725, 'dropoff')
(2, 1570321092, 'pickup')
(3, 1570321212, 'pickup')
(3, 1570322352, 'dropoff')
(2, 1570323012, 'dropoff')

The h-index is a metric used to measure the impact and productivity of a scientist or researcher.

A scientist has index h if h of their N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N - h papers have no more than h citations each. If there are multiple possible values for h, the maximum value is used.

Given an array of natural numbers, with each value representing the number of citations of a researcher's paper, return the h-index of that researcher.

For example, if the array was:

[4, 0, 0, 2, 3]

This means the researcher has 5 papers with 4, 1, 0, 2, and 3 citations respectively. The h-index for this researcher is 2, since they have 2 papers with at least 2 citations and the remaining 3 papers have no more than 2 citations.

You are writing an AI for a 2D map game. You are somewhere in a 2D grid, and there are coins strewn about over the map.

Given the position of all the coins and your current position, find the closest coin to you in terms of Manhattan distance. That is, you can move around up, down, left, and right, but not diagonally. If there are multiple possible closest coins, return any of them.

For example, given the following map, where you are x, coins are o, and empty spaces are . (top left is 0, 0):

---------------------
| . | . | x | . | o |
---------------------
| o | . | . | . | . |
---------------------
| o | . | . | . | o |
---------------------
| . | . | o | . | . |
---------------------

return (0, 4), since that coin is closest. This map would be represented in our question as:

Our position: (0, 2)
Coins: [(0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 2)]
