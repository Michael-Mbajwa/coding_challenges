def passing_cars(arr):
    """
    A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The consecutive elements of array A represent
    consecutive cars on a road.
    Array A contains only 0s and/or 1s:
        0 represents a car traveling east,
        1 represents a car traveling west.
    The goal is to count passing cars. We say that a pair of cars (P, Q), where 0 â‰¤ P < Q < N, is passing when
    P is traveling to the east and Q is traveling to the west.
    For example, consider array A such that:
        A[0] = 0
        A[1] = 1
        A[2] = 0
        A[3] = 1
        A[4] = 1
    We have five pairs of passing cars: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4).
